### Task Control API in FreeRTOS - Efficient Delays with vTaskDelay (Blocked State).</br>
This coding implementation gives an overview of creating efficient delays using vTaskDelay( const TickType_t xTicksToDelay ), available in Task Control API in FreeRTOS using port for Tiva C Launchpad (TM4C123GH6PM). The implementation also explores the various options available in **FreeRTOSConfig.h** file to configure RTOS scheduler at various modes, task priorities and many other options.</br>

The implementation toggles on-board LEDs using an accurate delay for 3 tasks with same priorities, by moving them to blocked state: 
- vRedLedControllerTask(void *pvParamters)
- vGreedLedControllerTask(void *pvParamters)
- vBlueLedControllerTask(void *pvParamters)</br>

while the **configTICK_RATE_HZ** is set at 1000Hz (1 milli second time quanta).</br>

vTaskDelay() specifies a time at which the task wishes to unblock relative to the time at which vTaskDelay() is called. For example, specifying a block period of 100 ticks will cause the task to unblock 100 ticks after vTaskDelay() is called. vTaskDelay() does not therefore provide a good method of controlling the frequency of a periodic task as the path taken through the code, as well as other task and interrupt activity, will effect the frequency at which vTaskDelay() gets called and therefore the time at which the task next executes. See vTaskDelayUntil() for an alternative API function designed to facilitate fixed frequency execution. It does this by specifying an absolute time (rather than a relative time) at which the calling task should unblock.
