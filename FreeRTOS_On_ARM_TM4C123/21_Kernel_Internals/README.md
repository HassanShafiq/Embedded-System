### Internels of a Real-Time Kernel

This coding implementation is analysed in debug mode and provides an look into the internel working of a real-time kernel, such as:

- adding a time base 
- blocking code vs non-blocking code 
- the exception stack frame
- how to create a custom exception stack frame
- switching between threads by swapping exception stack frames in processor
