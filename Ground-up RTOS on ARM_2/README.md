### **~\Ground-up RTOS on ARM_2 (Advanced Concepts)<br/>**

Contains implementations for the course: **Build Your Own RealTime OS (RTOS) From Ground Upâ„¢ on ARM 2**

This course teaches how to build a Real-Time Operating Systems through intensive practice and theory. It starts by getting you excited through an introduction to the internals of a Real-Time Kernel on ARM Processors, which you shall implement yourself in code.Then we move on to learn all there  is about Real-Time Operating Systems, their various parts, how they work and then we finally build our own Real-Time Operating System exploring different scheduling algorithms and Inter-Thread communication tools.

Each project folder in this sub-repository contains its own README.md file providing brief description of the implementation.
