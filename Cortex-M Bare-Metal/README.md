## ~\Cortex-M Bare-Metal</br>
Contains coding implementations for the course: **Complete ARM Cortex-M Bare-Metal Programming Ground Upâ„¢**

This course teaches Cortex-M Internals, Pointers, Structures, Memory Navigation, Debugging, CMSIS,Assembly etc and how to navigate the microntroller reference manual and datasheet to extract the right information to professionally build peripheral drivers (ADC, UART, GPIO, TIMER etc.) and firmware. To achieve this goal, no libraries are used in this course, purely ARM Assembly Language and bare-metal embedded C
