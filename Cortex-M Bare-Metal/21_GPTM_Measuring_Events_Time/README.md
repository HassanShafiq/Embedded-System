## GPTM Events-Interval Mode Implementation</br>
This exercise introduces General Purpose Timers (GPTM peripheral) on Tiva C Lanuchpad (TM4C123GH6PM) and uses a 16-bit Timer0 A configured as Events-Interval timer on Rising Edge of clock cycles, with TM4C core running at 16MHz. The Tiva C Lanchpad is interfaced with **HC-SR04 Ultrasonic sensor** for non-contact distance measurement.
