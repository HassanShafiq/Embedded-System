#### **~\Ground-up RTOS on ARM_1<br/>**
Contains implementations for the course: **[Build Your Own RealTime OS (RTOS) From Ground Upâ„¢ on ARM 1](https://www.udemy.com/course/rtos-building-from-ground-up-on-arm-processors/)**

This course teaches how to build a Real-Time Operating System from scratch, building up basic a real-time kernel and a scheduler from scratch, along with coding implementation. It starts by getting you excited through an introduction to the internals of a Real-Time Kernel on ARM Processors, which you implement yourself in code.Then we move on to learn all there  is about Real-Time Operating Systems, their various parts, how they work and then we finally build our own Real-Time Operating System exploring different scheduling algorithms, task signaling, synchronization and inter-thread communication tools.

Each project folder in this sub-repository contains its own README.md file providing brief description of the implementation.
