# Embedded-System
This repository contains my coding implementations for Udemy based Embedded Systems and RTOS courses.
Development Board used: EK-TM4C123GXL based on TM4C123GH6PM MCU (Texas Instruments)

~\Cortex-M Bare-Metal
Contains implementations for the course: Complete ARM Cortex-M Bare-Metal Programming Ground Up™

This course teaches Cortex-M Internals, Pointers, Structures, Memory Navigation, Debugging, CMSIS,Assembly etc and how to navigate the microntroller reference manual and datasheet to extract the right  information to professionally  build peripheral drivers (ADC, UART, GPIO, TIMER etc.) and firmware. To achieve this goal, no libraries are used in this course, purely ARM Assembly Language and bare-metal embedded C

~\FreeRTOS_On_ARM_TM4C123
Contains implementations for the course: FreeRTOS From Ground Up™ on ARM Processors

This course teaches the foundations of real-time systems and how to build real-time applications using FreeRTOS ,one of the most popular real-time operating systems  for embedded systems.  The course gives a detailed overview of the characteristics of the FreeRTOS real-time kernel,  provides a detailed tutorial on the APIs to implement the various features of FreeRTOS  and then goes on to build about 50 real-time projects.

~\Ground-up RTOS on ARM_1
Contains implementations for the course: Build Your Own RealTime OS (RTOS) From Ground Up™ on ARM 1

This course teaches how to build a Real-Time Operating Systems through intensive practice and theory. It starts by getting you excited through an introduction to the internals of a Real-Time Kernel on ARM Processors, which you shall implement yourself in code.Then we move on to learn all there  is about Real-Time Operating Systems, their various parts, how they work and then we finally build our own Real-Time Operating System exploring different scheduling algorithms and Inter-Thread communication tools.

~\Ground-up RTOS on ARM_2 (Advanced Concepts)
Contains implementations for the course: Build Your Own RealTime OS (RTOS) From Ground Up™ on ARM 2

This course teaches how to build a Real-Time Operating Systems through intensive practice and theory. It starts by getting you excited through an introduction to the internals of a Real-Time Kernel on ARM Processors, which you shall implement yourself in code.Then we move on to learn all there  is about Real-Time Operating Systems, their various parts, how they work and then we finally build our own Real-Time Operating System exploring different scheduling algorithms and Inter-Thread communication tools.
